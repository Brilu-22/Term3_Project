## About the Project 
### Embark on Elegance: Discover Mystical Wonders Aboard

This was a school project where we had to create our own cruise website. My cruise website is a gateway to unparalleled adventures. The website showcases these different mystical worlds we've only read about in storybooks, but at ATLAS we offer this once in a lifetime experience to travel the four seas and enjoying the beauty of these lands.
